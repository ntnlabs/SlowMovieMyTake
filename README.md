# My approach to SlowMovie idea

Main idea seen here: https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SlowMovie

## Instructions
1. Install ffmpeg with pip install ffmpeg
2. Install PIL with pip install Pillow
3. Run code

### Some prerequisites
- hardlinked Videos folder
- hardlinked video

# Project status
After running the code (in GUI), script opens video frame by frame in default image viewer and waits for Enter, then proceeds to next frame.

## Planned ideas
- running with ePaper screen
- running with Ascii convertor so the image can be seen in console [**IT WORKS !**](test3-ascii.py) :D
